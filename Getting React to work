Getting Code to Work:

1. download all of the folders and files
2. put all contents into one folder
3. extract 'build.zip' into the same folder
4. run 'npm install' in terminal (w/o quotes) in the directory of this folder
    OPTIONAL: run 'npm prune' after step 4 in case unnecessary packages install
5. put in DB info in the server.js
6. have two terminals open, one for react and one for node
7. in one, run 'node server.js'
8. the other, run 'npm start'
9. If you encounter npm issues -> remove node_modules -> npm install
